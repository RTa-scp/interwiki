# Interwiki

This is the Interwiki module for the [SCP Wiki](https://scpwiki.com), the
English-speaking branch of SCP, used for displaying translations of
articles in the [international SCP community](http://scp-int.wikidot.com/).

This Interwiki module is [forked](https://github.com/SCP-CN-Tech/Interwiki)
from [SCP 基金会](http://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/), the Chinese branch of
SCP, and was originally made by 7happy7.

# Development

Install locally with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```shell
npm install
```

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for formatting:

```shell
npm run format
```

Development is intentionally simple and we have no compile step. New code
should be written in ES5 and be executable on older browsers.
